Simulation Task
This code 

Requirements
This code uses Python2.7 and matlabplot. 
(We adopt pylab to store figures. It is contained in matlabplot.)

How to run
Run the program:
    python model.py parameter
The parameter is to choose the value of probability(a newly activated node u activates a network neighbor v). It includes four mode values:
    0 - Heterogeneous
    1 - Low
    2 - Medium
    3 - High
In the end, the program will save figure named 'simulate_mode.png'
